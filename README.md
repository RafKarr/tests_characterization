# Repository Stage Horizontal Attacks ECC

### This repository contains the work from the internship of Rafael Carrera Rodriguez in the laboratory LCIS, under supervision of Vincent Beroulle and Yann Kieffer.

### The content is divided into two principal folders:
- matlab_scripts : Contains all work done in Matlab for trace acquisition, trace anaylsis and simulations.
- vhdl : VHDL implementation of the interface of the DSP of the FPGA with a UART module. Includes code, simulation, constraints and bitstreams to program the device

### Each of the folders contains their own README.md file, that explains in detail the contents.
